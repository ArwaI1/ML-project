# ML-project
The notebook demonstrates a machine learning workflow. It begins by importing necessary libraries and loading a dataset. It then preprocesses the data and trains various models including Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
